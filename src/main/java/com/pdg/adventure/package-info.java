/*
 * TODO:
 *  - extend parser
 *    - add word type PREPOSTION
 *    - add second noun
 *    - add adverb
 *    - allow conjunctions through AND and THEN
 *    - allow speech (to interact with other characters, for instance SAY "Hello" )
 *    - allow all objects to be referenced by IT, thus, remember previous noun(s?)
 *  - add special locations (workaround exist)
 *    - objects not available in any location (no, use flags)
 *    - objects worn (no, use objects)
 *  - add FollowupActions to PreConditions (no, current design is sufficient)
 *  - add serialization via https://github.com/nitrite/nitrite-java (no, not sufficiently ready)
 *
 *  For more ideas, see: https://worldofspectrum.org//pub/sinclair/games-info/p/ProfessionalAdventureWriter_IntroductionManual.pdf
